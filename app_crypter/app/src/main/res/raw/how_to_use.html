            <strong>
                <u>Keystore</u>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Instead using a disposable password each time, the user can use the
            <b>Keystore</b>
            in order to
            generate keys linked to an alias.
            Then to encrypt or to decrypt, the user just need to select an alias.
        </p>
        <p>The Keystore is protected by an user password. All keys generated are retained encrypted
            in the device.
        </p>
        <p>By default, the password used to generate one key is not retained.
        </p>
        <p>If the user prefer to share its passwords instead of the keys with another device, then
            the
            password can be retained
            encrypted with a non reversible encryption method. This allow one device which do not
            own the key used to encrypt
            to be able to decrypt only with the password used to encrypt it.
        </p>
        <p>In order to retain the password (non reversible encrypted), the user must uncheck
            himself the checkbox <b>Nullify Password</b> when creating a new key.

        </p>
        <p>The sharing is done with a 2 steps protocol <u><b>started by the receiver</b></u>. The receiver
            need to send one public key to the sender. Then the sender
            encrypt his key and send it to the receiver.

                <u>Strict mode</u>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>By default, for each encryption the salt, the iteration number, the key length and the
            encryption algorithm are appended
            to the encrypted data in order to rebuilt the key from the password. Therefore you can
            decrypt the data with the password or the key
        </p>
        <p>The user can also activate the option <b>Strict mode</b>. With this mode, no information
            to rebuild the key from the password
            are appended to the encrypted data. Only the key can decrypt the data (In order to add
            another protection level against any dictionaries attacks).
            With this mode, it is very important that the user do a backup of his keys with
            <b>Export all keys</b>
            features and keep them in safe place.
        </p>
        <p>Lose these
            keys and it will be impossible to decrypt your data

            <strong>
                <u>Notes</u>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>-Encrypted files/texts will have ".cfx" or ".ctx" extension and will be in android media
            folder
            <b>Documents</b>
            or inside the
            <b>user defined Directory</b>
        </p>
        <p>-Each encryption is done with an AES key randomly generated from the password or the key
            bound to an alias
        </p>
        <p>-Decrypted files will be in your android media folder (Pictures, Music, Movies or
            Documents) or inside the
            <b>user defined directory</b>
        </p>
        <p>-Decrypted files will have the original file name maybe with a copy number if one
            file with this name exist already
        </p>
        </br>

            <strong>
                <u>How Encryption is done?</u>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>-Encryption is done with the method chosen by user (AES_CTR, AES_CBC, AES_GCM).
            Recommended method is AES_GCM. Other method (AES_CTR, AES_CBC) are also secure enough
            and little bit faster
        </p>
        <p>-Each Secret key is derived from password with PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 algorithm</p>
        <p>-Each Secret key length is chosen by user (128, 192, 256).
            Recommended length are 256 even if (128, 192) are as much secure
        </p>
        <p>-Each iteration count and salt are randomly generated for each new Secret key with the
            algorithm SHA1PRNG
        </p>
        <p>-Encrypted data are signed with HmacSHA256 algorithm</p>
        <p>-For each encryption a new randomly IV generated with the algorithm SHA1PRNG is used</p>
        <p>-For each Signature a new randomly IV generated with the algorithm SHA1PRNG is used along
            the tag
        </p>
        <p>-Only for the encryption of text, the user can chose an encryption without signing and
            authentication in order to reduce the length of the message. It is also secure enough,
            but we recommend
            to let the signing and authentication. If the message length is a problem for you,
            just share your encrypted text as file.
        </p>
        <p>-Sharing a key with is done with a pair of asymmetric keys generated on both device then
            send with ECDH protocol
